# algotrading
Author: Malay Agarwal

This is an algotrading system I built. It shows all the way from data collection to backtesting to live trading. Uses the MACD (Moving Average Convergence Divergence) as the signal.

Implements genetic algorithm, data collection, data processing, REST api connection, finance knowledge.

This took a few weeks of work. This is a very basic level of creating an automated trading system, and is the most I can show without giving away my best strategies. The P/L is not great, but expected from using a simple moving average crossover.
