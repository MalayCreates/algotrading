# This is a simple genetic algorithm with an O(mng) complexity
# Runs each individual through a backtest 
# through a random quarter each generation to not overfit
# Each trait is a signal for BTO/STO/BTC/STC
# Crossover is handled by randomly selecting which traits get crossed
# Two random individuals from top 7 get picked to crossover
